# Yeung_et_al_2018_TissueSpecificity

These are scripts I used for all downstream analyses in [Yeung, Mermet, et al 2018](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/28/2/182.full). 

A review of some of the insights we gained from the analyses can be found in [Yeung, Naef et al 2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30309754).

This is a dump of many scripts, so I will soon link to an R package that highlights some of things you can do to analyze circadian gene expression across tissues.
